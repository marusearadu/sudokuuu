Pretty much finished implementing the back-end.

The whole backend was manually tested through REPL. Unit tests are yet to be implemented.

Well, a lot of problems were met - but all were solved quite easily (or sometimes laboriously :) )

I have no idea because I'm bad at time management.
But I'd say about ~30h (?)

Managed much more stuff than previously, but still a lot to do.
