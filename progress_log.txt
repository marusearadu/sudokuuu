Close to finishing the project; some small bug, a reimplementation, and finishing up the color scheme and the buttons is all that remains.

No progress on testing since last time.

I don't even know where to start, so i think i'll just put it bluntly - way too many problems, all were dealt with, but oh god the scalafx
documentation is miserable and i wish there was someone who could kinda supervise my progress hourly/daily and nudge me into the right direction
when i go off the beaten track.

Lost in time honestly.

Managed quite a lot though.
