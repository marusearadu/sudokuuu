All the grid-related classes (i.e. Grid, GridRegion, GridCell) and their respective features have been implemented.

All the GridRegion & GridCell methods have been manually tested, albeit only on small example. No mistakes were found; however, unit-testing will be soon implemented to assure good functionality. The Grid class is yet to be tested.
What possibly difficult errors have occurred and have they been resolved?

Specifically, in order to color the GridRegion objects, they have to be initialized with their respective color.
However, knowing their respective colors require already knowing all the neighbourhood-relations, implying the objects have already been initialized.
A simple solution (the one currently implemented) is to initialize all the GridRegion objects with a default white color and then to change colors on the go.
Another possible solution is to check neighbourhoods on-the-go and to color them according to the neighbouring GridRegions that have so far been colored.

5h :)

Quite some busy 2 weeks because of exam week and then moving-in week, so didn't manage to do that much. But really looking forward to gaining more progress soon.
